# JSON Remix

With [JSON Remix](https://remix.wemakers.dev/), you can modify mock json data.  

Existing services like [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/) allow you to generate mock data easily. But they cannot possibly conceive of every category. If there is a data category you have in mind, you can first generate data from an external source. 

Import it on JSON Remix and add a new key.  You can gives examples of values of that new key.  It can then spread instances of those values throughout your entire json file.  And you can export the new json data as a file.
